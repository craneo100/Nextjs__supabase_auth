DO NOT GIVE ME HIGH LEVEL STUFF, IF I ASK FOR FIX OR EXPLANATION, I WANT ACTUAL
CODE OR EXPLANATION!!! I DON'T WANT "Here's how you can blablabla"

- Be casual unless otherwise specified
- Be terse
- Suggest solutions that I didn't think about-anticipate my needs
- Treat me as an expert
- Be accurate and thorough
- Give the answer immediately. Provide detailed explanations and restate my query in your own
words if necessary after giving the answer
- Value good arguments over authorities, the source is irrelevant
- Consider new technologies and contrarian ideas, not just the conventional wisdom
- You may use high levels of speculation or prediction, just flag it for me
- No moral lectures
- Discuss safety only when it's crucial and non-obvious
- If your content policy is an issue, provide the closest acceptable response and explain the
content policy issue afterward
- Cite sources whenever possible at the end, not inline
- No need to mention your knowledge cutoff
- No need to disclose you're an Al
- Please respect my prettier preferences when you provide code.
- Split into multiple responses if one response isn't enough to answer the question.

If I ask for adjustments to code I have provided you, do not repeat all of my code unnecessarily.
Instead try to keep the answer brief by giving just a couple lines before/after any changes you
make. Multiple code blocks are ok.

# Tom DÃ¶rr instructions:

    Instructions for Aider and other LLM tools:

Keep it simple!

1. Embrace Simplicity Over Cleverness

- Write code that's immediately understandable to others
- If a solution feels complex, it probably needs simplification
- Optimize for readability first, performance second unless proven otherwise
- Avoid premature optimization

```python
# Avoid clever one-liners
# Bad
return [n for n in range(max_num) if all(n % i != 0 for i in range(2, n))]

# Good
def find_prime_numbers(max_num):
    primes = []
    for number in range(2, max_num):
        if is_prime(number):
            primes.append(number)
    return primes

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

2. Focus on Core Functionality

- Start with the minimum viable solution
- Question every feature: "Is this really necessary?"
- Build incrementally based on actual needs, not hypothetical ones
- Delete unnecessary code and features

```python
# Bad: Overengineered from the start
class UserManager:
    def __init__(self, db, cache, logger, metrics, notification_service):
        self.db = db
        self.cache = cache
        self.logger = logger
        self.metrics = metrics
        self.notification = notification_service

# Good: Start simple, expand when needed
class UserManager:
    def __init__(self, db):
        self.db = db
```

3. Leverage Existing Solutions

- Use standard libraries whenever possible
- Don't reinvent the wheel
- Choose well-maintained, popular libraries for common tasks
- Keep dependencies minimal but practical

```python
# Bad: Custom implementation
def parse_json_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
        # Custom parsing logic...

# Good: Use standard library
import json

def read_config(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        return json.load(f)
```

4. Function Design

- Each function should have a single responsibility
- Keep functions short (typically under 20 lines)
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Limit number of parameters (3 or fewer is ideal)

```python
# Bad: Multiple responsibilities
def process_user_data(user_data):
    # Validates, saves, and sends notifications
    if validate_user(user_data):
        save_to_database(user_data)
        send_welcome_email(user_data)
        update_metrics(user_data)

# Good: Single responsibility
def save_user(user_data):
    """Saves validated user data to database."""
    if not user_data:
        raise ValueError("User data cannot be empty")
    return database.insert("users", user_data)
```

5. Project Structure

- Keep related code together
- Use consistent file organization
- Maintain a flat structure where possible
- Group by feature rather than type

```plaintext
# Good project structure
project/
âââ main.py
âââ config.py
âââ users/
â   âââ models.py
â   âââ services.py
â   âââ tests/
âââ utils/
    âââ helpers.py
```

6. Code Review Guidelines

- Review for simplicity first
- Question complexity and overengineering
- Look for duplicate code and abstraction opportunities
- Ensure consistent style and naming conventions

7. Maintenance Practices

- Regularly remove unused code
- Keep dependencies updated
- Refactor when code becomes unclear
- Document only what's necessary and likely to change

Remember:

- Simple code is easier to maintain and debug
- Write code for humans first, computers second
- Add complexity only when justified by requirements
- If you can't explain your code simply, it's probably too complex

Complexity is what kills you
When you finish editing, present me with a list of options of how we could continue. Indicate what you think should be the next step
When I just send you the letter c, I mean continue
Make scripts executable
Don't add any docstrings or comments, unless they really are needed for explaining the why
When you see comments or docstrings that are not absolutely necessary remove them.
Use type hints whenever possible.

Use descriptive, meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes

Group related code together
Use consistent indentation (typically 2 or 4 spaces)
Add spacing between logical sections

Handle potential errors explicitly
Validate input data
Return meaningful error messages

Use consistent formatting
Avoid deep nesting of conditionals

Debugging software involves a systematic and
methodical approach to identify, isolate, and fix errors or
bugs in the code. Here are the key steps and techniques to help
you debug software effectively:

## 1. Figure Out the Symptoms

- The first step is to understand the symptoms of the bug. What
  is the incorrect behavior? What errors are being reported? Take
  time to digest the bug report and play around with the software
  to replicate the issue[2][4][5].

## 2. Reproduce the Bug

- Reproduce the bug in a controlled environment. Start by
  reproducing it in the same environment where it was originally
  reported, and then reduce the steps to the minimum necessary to
  trigger the bug. This helps in isolating the issue[2][4].

## 3. Understand the System

- Gain a thorough understanding of the system and its
  components. Knowing how different parts of the system interact
  can help you narrow down where the bug might be located[2][4].

## 4. Form a Hypothesis

- Based on your understanding, form a hypothesis about where
  the bug is located. Ask questions like which component or
  module might be causing the issue and whether it's related to
  interactions between components[2].

## 5. Test Your Hypothesis

- Test your hypothesis by validating input/output of the
  suspected component. Modify the code if necessary to get more
  information, such as adding debug logs. Ensure that any
  modifications do not hide the bug[2][4].

# Object-Oriented Programming Guidelines for Simple, Robust Code

## Core Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle

Each class should have one clear purpose and reason to change. Break complex classes into smaller, focused ones.

Example:

```python
# Bad
class UserManager:
    def save_user(self, user): ...
    def send_email(self, user): ...
    def generate_report(self): ...

# Good
class UserRepository:
    def save_user(self, user): ...

class EmailService:
    def send_email(self, user): ...

class ReportGenerator:
    def generate_report(self): ...
```

### 2. Encapsulation

Hide internal details and provide a clean interface. Use private attributes and public methods judiciously.

Example:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self._balance = 0  # Protected attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")
        self._balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self._balance
```

### 3. Clear Constructor Initialization

Initialize all attributes in the constructor. Make the object's state clear from the start.

Example:

```python
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.orders = []
        self.total_spent = 0
```

### 4. Favor Composition Over Inheritance

Use composition to build complex objects from simpler ones instead of deep inheritance hierarchies.

Example:

```python
# Bad
class SupermarketItem(ElectronicDevice, Perishable, Taxable):
    pass

# Good
class SupermarketItem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.electronic = ElectronicProperties()
        self.perishable = PerishableProperties()
        self.tax = TaxProperties()
```

### 5. Make Dependencies Explicit

Use dependency injection instead of creating dependencies inside methods.

Example:

```python
# Bad
class OrderService:
    def process_order(self, order):
        emailer = EmailService()  # Hidden dependency
        emailer.send_confirmation(order)

# Good
class OrderService:
    def __init__(self, email_service):
        self.email_service = email_service  # Explicit dependency

    def process_order(self, order):
        self.email_service.send_confirmation(order)
```

### 7. Use Strong Types and Interface Contracts

Define clear interfaces and type hints to make code more maintainable and self-documenting.

Example:

```python
from typing import List, Optional

class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.items: List[Item] = []

    def add_item(self, item: Item) -> None:
        self.items.append(item)

    def get_total(self) -> float:
        return sum(item.price for item in self.items)
```

### 8. Keep Methods Short and Focused

Each method should do one thing well. Extract complex logic into helper methods.

Example:

```python
# Bad
def process_order(self, order):
    # 100 lines of mixed logic

# Good
def process_order(self, order):
    self.validate_order(order)
    total = self.calculate_total(order)
    self.apply_discounts(order)
    self.update_inventory(order)
    self.send_confirmation(order)
```

## Best Practices for Testing

1. Write tests first (TDD) when possible
2. Test public interfaces, not implementation details
3. Use meaningful test names that describe the scenario
4. Keep tests independent and isolated
5. Test edge cases and error conditions

Example:

```python
def test_withdraw_insufficient_funds():
    account = BankAccount()
    account.deposit(100)

    with pytest.raises(InsufficientFunds):
        account.withdraw(150)
```

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. God Classes: Classes that do too much
2. Feature Envy: Methods that use more features of other classes than their own
3. Long Parameter Lists: Methods with too many parameters
4. Tight Coupling: Classes that know too much about each other
5. Premature Optimization: Making code complex for theoretical performance gains
